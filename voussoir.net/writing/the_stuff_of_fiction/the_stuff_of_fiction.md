free for all passengers, no cost to ride

centers, living post-scarcity  
no owners, no renters, no debt collectors  
for there is no debt, no cause for defectors

mathematical constants pay me a visit  
np-easy, log-log bound  
fifth dimension sights and sounds  
algebraic breakfast, quantum dessert   
daily discovery, breakthrough first  
sinusoidal poetry, the meanings in fields  
electromagnetic, temporal, deftly revealed  
through fourier transforms, the radio spectrum

with nothing but architectural rules  
bottomless gigabytes to store all your stuff  
yet feeling content what you have is enough  
forcefield, atlantis, undersea dome  
heart of the volcano that i call home

becomes invisible under this cloak

telepathic mindwaves, toilets with bells  
and whistles and three seashells

now so far this is all quite simplistic  
but if you want to hear something futuristic:  
how about a taskbar you can rearrange  
up down left right unconstrained  
audio signal carried on a line  
tip ring sleeve, timeless design  
such simplicity and ease  
let's make smarter things with these  
an interface whose color can be changed  
styled, freely themed if so deranged  
interoperable protocols sans garden walls  
compatible messages, encrypted, all  
words spoken softly on wires  
unsold, unhired by advertisers  
online, offline, hardware switch  
computed locally without a hitch  
a cable functions on my behalf  
facilitates the six-inch data path  
from point to point or box to box  
without dns and thirty hops  
options, menus, controls, the works  
no microservices, my gigahertz  
datamined data, mine, unconfined  
open standards, spec defined  
it just plugs in, it just connects  
i trust it works without defects  
and lest it break by my own mistake  
or wear with age, from old books we take  
a useful page, repair  
with parts acquired fair and square  
don't be fooled by malediction  
none of this is science fiction  
all could be ours, i've bated breath  
the technology just isn't quite there yet
