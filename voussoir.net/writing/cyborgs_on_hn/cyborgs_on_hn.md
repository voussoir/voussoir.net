Cyborgs on HN
=============

This page collects comments which make unnecessary or tenuous analogies to computers, programming, dollar-sign $variables, sed's/replace/syntax/g, mathematics, AI/machine learning, and cryptography in discussions that aren't about those things.

> \> It really cannot be overstated enough the wealth divide that pandemic QE created.

> :s/\\\<created\\\>\.$/exacerbated./

-

> At $oldjob, taking care of a busy and successful web estate that is now close to 25 years old, one of the ugliest and longest-standing warts was the "image store". That was a simple, flat directory on a single node, shared over NFS, which had accumulated more than 1.2 million (yes, 1_200_000) inodes/files in a single directory.

-

> s/popular/common/
> I sometimes wish portrait oriented 4:3 monitors had become the dominant form.

-

> I couldn't supply enough work for the contractors (we had to rush into it because ${life reasons}, so not everything was specced out when the work started)

-

> IIUC this is what iMessage does (at least when Messages in iCloud or whatever it's called is disabled), except s/people/devices:

-

> I work at $LARGE_CORPORATION and our product a11y team's most recent major ship was a new palette of colors with improved contrast ratios.

-

> Welp, looks like that tweet got censored\^Wdeleted.

-

> s/tiktok/uber/g

-

> The comments on the site have become predictable enough to be GPT generated.

-

> My personal experience with devs who don't want to GPL their code or contribute to GPL projects is that they're under the impression that having a permissive license on their own project will get $corp to use it and, somehow, they'll profit from $corp using it.

-

> s/Android/Windows/ and s/Europe/USA/ and it could be Microsoft at the end of the antitrust case in the 90s.

-

> Large vehicles are safer for vehicle-on-vehicle or vehicle-on-object crashes, and vehicle-on-pedestrian crashes are a very small fraction of total fatal crashes. The core objection of this blog post\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H paper is nonsense.

-

> I love stories of little quirky & fable-like people who are known as "that X person", and they seem to be a master at whatever X is. Creates a real charming atmosphere wherever these people exist.

> > I imagine some of us are those kind of X persons in other peoples lives, where X ∈ {Computer, Science, Internet}.

-

> \#upvotes !~ effort put into comment

-

> Telling X and doing !X is not a recent invention.

-

> Forgive me if I'm wrong but I suspect this comment is GPT3 generated. Regardless, it was hilariously absurd.

-

> I'm sure this is good, like, really really good, but I'm struck by the feeling that it wants to baby talk me the same way Godel, Escher, Bach did.

> I mean, it reads like a Homestuck pesterlog.

> > Perhaps it's written by GPT-3..

-

> If I see someone is typing in a Slack channel, or typing to me privately, it takes all my focus away until it is complete.

> > that means a person can DOS you by typing and erasing text but never sending you a message?

-

> Identifying this usage would require the compiler to be aware of the version control system, and still wouldn't correctly identify that the version sent from $COWORKER via email for some weird reason isn't a gradual change.

-

> Is this a GPT-3 generated post? It reads like an answer to a completely different different question that just happens to hit the same keywords (e.g. "pay", "smart", "comfort", "social class"...)

-

> I couldn't download .exe files at some $CORPORATION. They had to be whitelisted or something, and the download just wouldn't work otherwise.

-

> I'm quite sure similar services can also be used by the average person. You simply google for these magical words '産廃業者 $CITY'.

-

> \> It might sound silly but I'm always amazed at the fresh perspectives I'm able to obtain when I ask "someone smarter" for advice in my imagination.

> > That sounds eerily like asking GPT3 to pretend to be someone else.

-

> But we're all living in the same system, and to put it in HN terms, we need to wipe and reinstall the OS.

-

> The only switch type where actuation == tactile feedback that I know of is buckling-spring, as in the IBM model M.

-

> I've always said it's not the Tree of Life, but rather the DAG of Life.

-

> I still don't understand why this is a website thing and not an user-agent\^W\^W webbrowser thing.

-

> My $DAYJOB task this week is beginning the process of splitting up a 14554 line C++ file.

-

> At $prevjob we had the ability to do things like this at the push of a button, and generally would have within 90min of incident onset to help systems heal.

-

> Correct. "Not doing $X anymore" doesn't mean you aren't an addict. "Being able to turn on/turn off doing $X" means you aren't an addict.

-

> Note this is amending existing law, so think of it as a legal diff.

-

> This native English speaker is with you, I thought RacquetNext was some new-fangled racquetball racket that was banned because it has carbon fiber plates that…do $SOMETHING, ala the Nike Vaporfly/Alphafly running shoes.

-

> At this point, the onus is to prove thing $x is not used for Google analytics.

-

> I don't think people do this because they want to be polite. The 'hello' is basically the start of what is the human equivalent of the TCP three way handshake.

> \- Hello (SYN)

> \> Hi (ACK)

> \- How are you doing ? (SYN, ACK)

> Basically, they are trying to set up a synchronous channel over what is essentially an asynchronous medium. This is even more annoying than just slowing down the answer, they are demanding your undivided attention during the conversation.

> > You know you are on HN when hello/hi is explained in terms of SYN/ACK and not the other way around

-

> I tried their "Best toaster" query and one thing I want to say is just how hilarious it is that "best x"-of-anything webpage HAS to have $CURRENT_YEAR in the title. Yelp does something similar to its Google search results.

> As if nothing good or the best in its breed ever came out from $PREVIOUS_YEAR or any previous years before that!

> Tell me you're a garbage SEO website without telling me, just slap on "in $CURRENT_YEAR" or use some capital letters, I love how easy it is to tell the wheat from the chaff!

> > Best $PRODUCT $CURRENT_YEAR can include products that were manufactured in $PREVIOUS_YEAR or $LONG_TIME_AGO. The $CURRENT_YEAR is saying that the list is up to date, not that all the items in the list were made in $CURRENT_YEAR.

-

> There is a joke I love that illustrates the concept:
"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my client was nowhere near the scene of the murder, he didn't mean to pull the trigger, and that son-of-a-bitch had it coming!"

> > What would that be in programmer speak?

> > The intern had no write access to the production database, he didn't mean to do the commit, and our network engineers had it coming?

-

> A new version with s/Stalin/Putin/ would be good, and perhaps given oligarchs etc. even funnier.

-

> When I'm tired and out of time instead of ordering an unhealthy meal from $FOODDELIVERYAPP$ I can (and very frequently do) buy something relatively healthier from such a site.

-

> But, every $BIG_CORP out there has on their roadmap a long-term plan to either drastically reduce their spend on Oracle products, or more often, eliminate it entirely.

-

> It's kind of terrible that you can use extensions XOR your own browser on iOS

-

> I'm currently job hunting, and a bit tired of sending out 3 - 5 apps a day via indeed or $COMPANY_SITE. Actually talking to someone would be nice.

-

> I immediately came home, tried logging into my online banking accounts, but couldn't due to 2FA. Of course, I won't be able to log in until a replacement phone arrives.

> > It's the same failure mode if you s/phone/token/.

-

> There is nothing in any dishwasher, fridge, vacuum cleaner, washing machine, ${you_name_the_home_appliance} that would require to be smarter than they are without those (actually far from smart) hardware and software that is being installed and imposed on customers.

-

> Typo in the headline: s/DNA/NDA/

-

> I distro hop with my home laptops and use Windows at $JOB

-

> \> If we assume that both groups visit government websites equally often

> My pattern matching experience from real life tells me that this is unlikely....

-

> The blog post misunderstand that many people that do that are simply using "hello" as a "ping" to see if someone's really there for immediate synchronous communication. They want to type just 1 word first ... and then wait for a human-style-TCP-ACKnowledgement

-

> Some grouping or merging of URLs for major news would be nice, though hard to implement. For example Apple releases a new product, new version of Firefox, new S1 filing of $unicorn.

-

> Yes, crows use poke, dig, find, free, head, tail, touch, more, mount, make. And if they don't like you, they use kill. Sometimes even killall.

> crows are unable to use git, but then even I was unable to use git right after onboarding.

-

> Unbounded extensibility is a great way to get adoption of a standard, in the sense that a lot of products will say "Fully $standard Compatible!" in their marketing materials. It is a bad way to ensure that the standard actually means anything outside the marketing materials.

-

> Then again, I've used mailing lists since UUCP and VMS, so maybe I'm just exp\^Wold.

-

> English is the javascript of languages: full of warts and enforcing a status quo that sucks but everyone has to learn it because this is the world we live in.

> Esperanto would be like Haskell: beautifully pure and regular but no one uses it except for a passionate community of die-hard zealots.

> Romance languages would be like scripting languages (Python, Ruby, lua, etc.): once you know one the others get really easy.

> Greek would be like Lisp: had a lot of influence on current languages, dwindled a bit, but is still around.

> Biology is what happens when you try to decompile code written in assembler into OO language.

-

> True statement. I lost a finger tip in a mandolin making potatoes lyonnaise. It mostly grew back. However, it has never felt the same. It's like the nerve endings in the finger tip throw unhandled exceptions.

-

> A lot of therapists have a two year degree.

> > What's your point?

> > > It's important to be careful about to whom you grant root access to your mind.

-

> For desktops HTTP2 is mostly ok, possibly an improvement. For Mobile it wasn't. I raised this when we were trailing in at $financial_media_company.

-

> Normally I have to rely on reddit posts or random blogs that I find with search terms like "$gameType game with no P2P/P2W" or "$gameType game with no IAP" but even that's not perfect.

-

> Sounds like Tamlin's 'assistant, a lawyer' is an id\^H\^H\^H\^H hasn't spent much time in the bush.

-

> Reads like it was written by GPT-3.

-

> At my $OLDJOB, I used ImageMagick to compare snapshots during some automated front-end testing on our public Drupal site.

-

> I'm perfectly happy to use my brain as an index instead of a data warehouse. As in, I don't bother committing to memory things that I can reach out and grab if they fall out of my "cache".

> > The problem for me now is my mental index can suffer from link rot.

-

> s/Browser/Chrome/, please.

-

> Spaces in filenames were a mistake to begin with.

> Spaces are used to separate parameters in the command line. There's also no real need for filenames to support spaces.

-

> If I have some solution that can solve some major $PROBLEM, but a side effect of that solution is that some small group of people "get paid to do nothing", I'm completely OK with that.

-

> Nginx is making the same mistakes that dethroned Apache. No one wants to fiddle with a web server. Default to $currentIndustryStandard, make it work, forward to my application.

-

> Messaging apps are more like postal services — "please deliver this message to $person" — you're describing driving across town to drop something in a mailbox directly.

-

> I suspect that you don't work at $BIG_CO and rather something more startup-y?

-

> \> Whales have the capability to far outstrip humans in intelligence (if you accept that neuron count and neuron connections are the raw inputs).

> Understood normally, the raw input also includes the software installed in the whale's brain. This limits the potential capability of whales.

> If you were to overwrite that with software of your own design, you'd have a robot in the body of a whale, but not an actual whale.

-

> Using it everyday too at $work, also used Slack and Gitter (and FreeNode/IRC FWIW).

-

> Literally everything you wrote applies exactly the same if you s/E.164 number/email address/g and s/SMS/email/g

-

> That's not really fair. You can want to have an "open enough" collaborative community without a trillion dollar company ($cloud_provider) steamrolling you and your work.

-

> I was having to compete with professional spammers\^H\^H\^H marketers for my friend's attention. It's gross.

-

> We use that gateway email address with our notification alert system at $WORK.

-

> Also, the page you were actually looking for is probably https://...

> > I appreciate that you might think that, and thank you, but I was only interested in the 404 page.

> > > ML fails again. They need better training data

-

> If you had to hazard a guess, what $EnterpriseVideoconferencingSuite would be most amenable to this sort of work?

-

> \> Which is of course a fairly hard problem to solve - if you aren't having 2.2 children per couple then your population is shrinking.

> You can increase throughput with parallelization or speedups of single threaded performance.

-

> \> Anyone who really wants to stop a gaming addiction can stop it - it is only a question of will.

> | sed "s/gaming/drug/"

-

> Continuing to support $x means continuing to defend attack surface that's implemented as $y year-old code, to deliver a feature that in $z the majority of people do not use

-

> Back when I worked at $HEALTHCARE_INUSRANCE_CO we were trying to solve this (more general problem) from the other side.

-

> s/make it impossible/make it prohibitively expensive/

-

> An interesting, short read is the difference between Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and the full FDA approval.

> Basically it is manufacturing, funding and red tape being the difference, nothing about safety or clinical trials differs.

> In software terms, EUA is parallel tracked sprints for clinical trials and manufacturing at same time vs. regular approval is Waterfall where manufacturing occurs after approval.

-

> s/Carlie/Charlie/, I assume?

-

> If a NN is equivalent to $sophisticated_algorithm, that's a positive, not a negative.

-

> In general he thinks a lot about tool kits and I think what we're seeing here is the math equivalent to being great at debugging.

-

> Yep. I have a buddy who works at $BIG_US_RETAILER and he weekly has to go into the stock room with a box cutter and scissors to destroy unsold clothing.

-

> Also, at $WORK we have three separate but related products, each with separate version numbers that we jumped at some point to reach the same value across all 3.

-

> Ask HN: Which "old" programming language(s) you still use in your $DAYJOB?

-

> That's a result of mindset and approach. Japanese can't focus on 2 or more problems, neither they can assess influence of one issue against another and see an ecosystem.

> > Yeah sort of lacking the concept of hierarchy and/or recursion. "We need Z to do Y to do X" - no no the operand can't be a pointer to executable address. That'll fault.

-

> It shouldn't take horrific accidents for us to suddenly decide to care about structural safety.

> > The problem is the same as it is in IT.

-

> a few years ago at $dayjob we had a fleet of CoreOS hosts.

-

> While the topic is certainly interesting, the way that this article is written feels odd. It reads (to me) like GPT-generated text.

-

> s/for JS/on NPM/

-

> In the case above it wanted me to write out "That fly was sitting on something weird" - but I had written "That fly was sitting on something unusual" which is a perfectly valid interpretation of the sentence, but because they basically did a strcmp() I got it "wrong".

-

> I've written on HN before about relatively simple things I have found useful (keeping a diary in $language, or watching films with $language audio)

-

> Is this why I always get text messages from one of my friends that say \> Liked "{$ENTIRE_CONTENTS_OF_PREVIOUS_MESSAGE}"?

-

> I remember when win2k was "the last good windows" and then windows xp after it. I $CURRENT-2 is always going to be considered "the last good windows".

-

> Bureaucracy isn't that different from code. Some of it's dead legacy that needs to be removed, some of it's legacy that needs to be improved/replaced, some of it's legacy that's good enough, some of it's there for a damn good reason no matter how ugly it looks.

> And when it comes to code, you probably trust devs who have specific insights into issues with code and promising replacements.

-

> At $OLDJOB we used to use nfs extensively, and a common desire was to run some command on the system where the files actually resided

> > By using $OLDJOB are you saying at every old job you ever held this was the case or just the last one? Because if it's just the last one you should have used

> >      const OLDJOB

> > Not sure why you used a variable in a comment, maybe because this is hackernews and you want to resonate with other programmers?

-

> In my opinion, the code was very difficult to read and even harder to understand for !expert javascript devs and even for experts.

-

> Is it just me or do "markets" feel like a really dumb AI that is incapable of any sort of strategic planning?

-

> My email looks like ${firstname}@${some-german-word}.jetzt and I never had a problem with German speaking people.

-

> For the "memorable phrase" thing, you may have already figured this out, but I find it's better to generate random passphrases for those. A string of words is a _lot_ easier to say and verify.

> > Yeah, he asked me for a new one as part of the reset (or just for his further amusement?!) - I just used my brain's PRNG for a few words for that.

-

> It would be tiring and a bit offensive to knowledgeable people, but maybe better then trying to debug the situation.

-

> I have a scheme to give addresses per service, but I do this with gmail on my domain. It goes like $ACCOUNT+$RANDOMLETTERS@$DOMAIN.$TLD

-

> did I ever say gmail.com \>\> no, but.. \> exactly, so let's try this again (goto 0)

-

> "We have to recalculate weight on airplanes" is just a proxy, a code smell.

-

> Hah. I regularly see patches whose review takes well over 100% the time it would have taken me to create the patch myself.

> But then I'm employed by $MEGA_CORP and part of the job description is "helping to build and maintain the OSS community", so helping novices create their first patches is a big part of that.

-

> You need so few subway drivers/conductors that does it really matter if you need one per train?

> Taxis are probably average a driver per 1.5 ish customers. Subway/train is hundreds.

> This reminds me of optimisation of non critical code. Sure its nice, but the cost/benefit is just not there.

-

> I think that JavaScript and Python, from my experience, certainly increase speed... but that definitely != productivity.

-

> But they could! It's as easy as saying "I can consult on $topic, please contact me to discuss details."

> If we chew on enough of these lozenges, will our teeth merge into one, curved megatooth?

> > And why haven't we evolved to have that yet anyway?

> > > Well, in software terms, you're describing a monolithic architecture.

> > > There is also the matter of how evolvable the platform would be. As a species, we're in the process of losing our wisdom teeth, and I suspect that would be harder to do if the skull/jaw/gum/tooth platform was... more tightly coupled, less modular.

-

> Maybe selling a banana taped to a wall could be a way for people to make money, considering one of those sold for ${OUTRAGE}.

-

> But americans do get marketing though. I bet you know about a bunch of companies that were doing $thing in $country before, probably with better outcomes, but never got the recognition.

-

> On the other hand, $OTHER_COUNTRY has a history of $BAD_THING, so the only conscientious thing to do is boycott everything their workers produce too.

-

-

> I've been watching a lot of bonsai YouTubers lately. The amazing thing about trees is how much abuse they will tolerate and still figure out some way to grow. You can find videos of somebody pruning all the leaf-bearing branches and half the roots off of a bonsai like it's nothing, fully expecting the tree to recover. Plants have a very flexible instruction set, something like a list of inner if-statements, which bonsai artists understand almost completely and use to dictate their growth. It seems like the default execution of this instruction set looks like "tree" when there are no particular challenges, but the plant would adapt to almost any trauma short of cutting it down to a 1ft high stump... and even then, you will find stumps growing branches.

-

> The difference is between hobbyist agriculture and commercial agriculture. In the latter, consistency, pests and disease become more complex issues to deal with. IMHO there are a lot of analogies to software engineering. Small projects can engage in practices that don't scale, like skipping QA, not adequately testing, inconsistent coding standards.

-

> For some reason this reminds me of the website kuro5hin and how trolling was perfected into a sort of discussion-malware there. With Holocaust denial, it's discussion-malware with a highly targeted purpose: recreating the societal situation where another Holocaust can occur.

-

> This is why you ALWAYS use a Privacy.com (or similar) virtual credit card with limited access to your bank account. It's the same as creating a separation between your API layer and DB layer.

-

> A lot of people who I knew as sympathetic and calm before they took management roles turned into something I could code in one minute: namely a program that asks "how much is this going to take?" and if your answer is above N hours/days then they say "no, we're not doing it".

-

If I had no scruples or morals and chose to drive Uber, I could make an obscene hourly wage simply by picking up elderly people and engaging them in conversation. Most phone scams rely upon preying upon vulnerable, lonely people like this so sadly, it's a public 0 day with no known fix.

> It's doubtful that any large bureaucracy can execute that decision quickly, though I do agree 3 years is way too long. I'd put 3 months as hard minimum even assuming every internal decision process went as smoothly as possible, and 6 months as a more realistic amount.

> This largely has nothing to do with how grievous the transgression is or how sincerely the management wants to do the right thing. It has to do with red tape that is designed from first principles to permit zero exceptions or special cases that can cut through it quickly.

> Brain is very active when you sleep, a lot is happening. Imagine sleep is just a mutex on big set of data on which computation needs to be made, compression, data reorganization, index optimizing. Data that you received that day is segregated , decisions are made which data to keep and which to delete. After that lock is freed and you wake up. If you don't sleep your system will run slower and slower over time and will timeout more and more queries until it will start to return corrupted data. You need to sleep to keep the system healthy.

It imposes the same memorization burden on everyone and the benefit is slightly more predictable pronunciation within each of a set of officially-blessed dialects.
