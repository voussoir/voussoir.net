Blacked out lens markings
=========================

My camera lenses have white lettering printed and etched into the front describing their properties. I decided to paint over it.

Why:

1. I like stuff that is debadged or debranded and I think it will look cool.

2. I think / assume that the white lettering is distracting and catches attention, which is bad for candids.

3. I don't need my lens to remind me what it is. [I'm the one who bought it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMO0mPb-DlM "Pulp Fiction - I don't need you to tell me how good my coffee is").

4. I don't need my lens to tell everyone else what it is. If they care, they'll ask. If they don't, I'll spare them the advertisement.

5. I have no intention of ever selling them.

I used some matte black enamel paint and a 2mm round brush. I got the best results by picking up **very** light amounts of paint and dabbing it on. Any attempt to stroke the brush or speed up the process resulted in a horrible texture. I did a few coats on each lens. If you are a chemist accustomed to handling individual molecules of substance at a time, you might have more patience for this. It doesn't look factory-perfect, but I am satisfied with the look and texture I got in the end.
