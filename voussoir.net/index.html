            <div class="cvitem_details">
                <p>Etiquette is a tag-based file organization system with a web interface, built with Flask and SQLite3. Tag-based systems solve problems that a traditional folder hierarchy can't: <em>which folder should a file go in if it equally belongs in both?</em> and <em>how do I make my files searchable without littering the filenames themselves with keywords?</em></p>
                <p>Etiquette is unique because the tags themselves are hierarchical. By tagging one of your vacation photos with the <code>family.parents.dad</code> tag, it will automatically appear in searches for <code>family.parents</code> and <code>family</code> as well. A traditional folder system, here called albums, is available to bundle files that always belong together without creating a bespoke tag to represent that bundle. Regardless, the files on disk are never modified.</p>

                <p>Timesearch is a package of tools for archiving data from reddit.com. Subreddits, user posts, comments, CSS files, and community wiki files can be downloaded and easily updated.</p>
                <p>Originally, it used the <code>timestamp</code> query parameter of reddit's elasticsearch, but since that feature's removal Timesearch instead queries the third-party pushshift.io database for preliminary data, then queries reddit for updated information about each item.</p>

                <p>The voussoirkit library contains code that I have found useful to include in my other projects. Everything from <code>bytestring</code> that converts integer numbers of bytes into "3.145 MiB" strings, to <code>pathclass</code> and <code>spinal</code> which provide object-oriented file and directory operations and copy routines. Some modules like <code>winglob</code> boost cross-compatibility by smoothing over differences between Windows and Unix. This way I can easily deploy new features and bug fixes to all my programs.</p>

                <p>YoutubeChannelDownloader was born out of a dissatisfaction with YouTube's own interface for keeping track of which videos I have already watched, as well as a desire to integrate with youtube-dl. YCDL makes it easy for me to watch through a channel's catalog of videos, picking which ones I'd like to download while ignoring the others. Plus, as it creates an offline database, it will retain metadata about videos even after they are removed or deleted from the original YouTube channel.</p>

            <div class="cvitem_details">
                <p>I use the wonderful program Sigil to edit epub files. Sigil has a python plugin system for which I have written a few modules. But, since the plugins can only operate on one book at a time while it is open in Sigil, I needed something a little different to edit epub files en masse.</p>
                <p>Epubfile is a simple library for automatically processing epubs. It comes with a number of builtin routines for what I do most often: merging multiple epubs into a single file, normalizing the internal file structure, and renaming the cover image file to leverage CBXShell so I get thumbnails in Windows Explorer.</p>

                <p>This repository is in archive status now and is rarely updated. From 2014 to 2016 I learned Python, SQL, and HTTP by writing bots for reddit and contributing to PRAW, the Python Reddit API Wrapper. I took requests on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/RequestABot">/r/RequestABot</a> and produced dozens of easily modifiable bots. The tasks ranged from "allow users to only make one post per day" to "allow moderators to write a post now and schedule it to appear later". With almost 400 stars now it is my most successful repository, though the code quality is not up to the same standards I have today.</p>

                <p>During my development of Etiquette, I have continuously aimed to make the API as accessible and automateable as possible. Getting a peek behind the scenes is as easy as adding <code>.json</code> to the URL. I owe much of my early learning to my work with the reddit API, and since then I've regularly automated web interactions and scraped web data with Python and <code>requests</code>. For sites without an actual API to speak of, I'm pretty good at reverse engineering from the Network panel and javascript source. Try me.</p>
